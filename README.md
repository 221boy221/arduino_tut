# Arduino in Unity tutorial  
Welcome to the tutorial for getting the Arduino to work with Unity!  

For this tutorial you will need a 2-Axis Joystick, an Arduino with a placement-board, 8 wires and a computer.  

First you need to pair the Joysticks with the placement-board.  
This is how you do it : http://imgur.com/XcCmni8  

Next you must connect the wires according to the picture below.

After that, you can connect the Arduino to your computer and start a programming software (Check www.CodeBender.cc).  

Now download all of our files from our github repository and put them in your unity projects folder.  

Start Unity and "Load Project", select our arduino_tut project and wait for it to open.

You now got the project working, the next thing you need to do is to put the code into your Arduino IDE so you can compile it into the arduino itself.

Open the file "Arduino.ino" which is located in the Scripts folder.

Copy and paste the code into your selected Arduino IDE, whether that be the Online Codebender or the local arduino IDE.

Press Compile / Build and your arduino should be good to go!

Get back into Unity and open the Prototype01 scene located in the _Scenes folder.

Press play and enjoy!

Open the file named "InputOutput.cs" if you are interested in the code itself.
